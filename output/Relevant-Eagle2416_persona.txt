Despite facing uncertainty, particularly with immigration and job market challenges, they remain pragmatic and inquisitive, engaging with online communities for information and support.

MOTIVATIONS:
Their primary motivations include maintaining legal status and employment in the US, securing financial stability for themselves and potentially their family, and finding a fulfilling career.

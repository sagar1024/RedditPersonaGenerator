# Reddit Persona Generator

Reddit Persona Generator is an application that scrapes Reddit user data and generates a structured user persona using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash.

## Features

1. Scrapes posts and comments from any public Reddit user profile
2. Uses Google Gemini API to generate a structured user persona
3. Persona output includes sections like name, occupation, motivations, behaviors, and citations.
4. Simple and intuitive Streamlit web interface
